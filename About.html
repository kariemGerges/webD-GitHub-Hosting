<p>My Name is Kariem Gerges, my major is CIT web development and that is my third degree.
        My first degree was in accounting. I worked as an accountant for 2 years I did not like it. Then I got my second degree in business then I did not like it either ðŸ˜€. And now I am working on my third degree.
